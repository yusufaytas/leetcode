/*
Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher,
write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia:
"A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each,
and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5
papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and
the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

public class HIndex {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int citations[] = {3, 0, 6, 1, 5};
    System.out.println(new HIndex().hIndex(citations));
  }

  public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
    if (citations.length == 0) {
      return 0;
    }
    Arrays.sort(citations);
    int currentHIndex = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < citations.length; i++) {
      final int value = citations[i], length = citations.length - i;
      if (value >= length) {
        currentHIndex = length;
        break;
      }
