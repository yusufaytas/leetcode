/*
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain
amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the
first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security
system connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were
broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers nums representing the amount of money of each house,
return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2),
because they are adjacent houses.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: 0
