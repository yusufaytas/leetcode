Given a non-negative integer c, decide whether there're two integers a and b such that a2 + b2 = c.

Example 1:

Input: c = 5
Output: true
Explanation: 1 * 1 + 2 * 2 = 5

Example 2:

Input: c = 3
Output: false

Example 3:

Input: c = 4
Output: true

Example 4:

Input: c = 2
Output: true

Example 5:

Input: c = 1
Output: true
