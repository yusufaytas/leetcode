/*
There are N students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not.
Their friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a direct friend of B,
and B is a direct friend of C, then A is an indirect friend of C. And we defined a friend circle
is a group of students who are direct or indirect friends.

Given a N*N matrix M representing the friend relationship between students in the class.
If M[i][j] = 1, then the ith and jth students are direct friends with each other, otherwise not.
And you have to output the total number of friend circles among all the students.

Example 1:

Input:
[[1,1,0],
 [1,1,0],
 [0,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, so they are in a friend circle.
The 2nd student himself is in a friend circle. So return 2.

[1,0,0,1],
[0,1,1,0],
[0,1,1,1],
[1,0,1,1]
