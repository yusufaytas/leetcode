/*
Given two strings s and t, your goal is to convert s into t in k moves or less.

During the ith (1 <= i <= k) move you can:

    Choose any index j (1-indexed) from s, such that 1 <= j <= s.length and j has not been chosen
    in any previous move, and shift the character at that index i times.
    Do nothing.

Shifting a character means replacing it by the next letter in the alphabet (wrapping around so that 'z' becomes 'a').
Shifting a character by i means applying the shift operations i times.

Remember that any index j can be picked at most once.

Return true if it's possible to convert s into t in no more than k moves, otherwise return false.
